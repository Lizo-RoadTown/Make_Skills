**An academic agentic-AI multiplayer world-building tool.** Students build their own AI in early university and carry it through their studies, leveling it up over time, taking it on real-world quests (build a website for a local business, reproduce a published methodology, compose music with an AI co-pilot), and eventually contributing to online neural network building with their classmates.

Open-source first, hosted second, both modes from day one.

## What it is, concretely

- **A multi-agent platform.** You build one orchestrator + a clan of specialist subagents (planner, researcher, writer, custom). Each is configurable separately.
- **A semantic memory layer.** Conversations, decisions, and lessons are extracted and stored in LanceDB. Future sessions recall what mattered without re-loading full transcripts.
- **A skill library.** Markdown files that codify how the agents work. Some skills graduate into hard-coded tools as you use them more.
- **An observability dashboard.** Token cost, latency, agent activity, recorder volume — visible in the UI.
- **A docs site.** Real software documentation at [humancensys.com/docs](https://humancensys.com/docs).
- **Pillar 1 (in design):** a Tomagotchi-meets-Spore character builder for your agent clan, with simple emotions, evolution as they gain skills, and a 3D viewport.
- **Pillar 2 (in design):** a quest system with curated and AI-generated tasks across music, business, science, social impact.
- **Phase 2 (post-MVP):** group quests, shared knowledge graphs, student-formed organizations, collective neural network design.

It's an **academic tool** — not a productivity assistant, not a chatbot. It teaches engineering through play.

## Quick start (self-host)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lizo-RoadTown/Make_Skills.git
cd Make_Skills

# 1. Configure the agent backend
cd platform/deploy
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or pick a different provider)
docker compose up -d --build

# 2. Run the web UI
cd ../../web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Full docs at [`docs/`](docs/) or [humancensys.com/docs](https://humancensys.com/docs).

Two deployment modes (always supported, parallel):

| | Self-host | Hosted-multitenant |
|---|---|---|
| Who runs it | You, on your machine or VPS | Liz, at humancensys.com |
| Auth | None | OAuth (TBD) |
| Data | All yours, local | Tenant-scoped, shared infrastructure |

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the layered model + container topology decisions.

## Model providers (Pillar 1 — pick your creature's brain)

Each subagent picks its own model. Currently supported:

| Provider | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| **Anthropic** (Claude) | Default; smart and cost-efficient |
| **OpenAI** (GPT) | OpenAI-specific features |
| **Google** (Gemini) | Generous free tier |
| **Hugging Face** (Inference Providers) | **Free tier path for students** |
| **Together AI** | Fast inference of open models |
| **Groq** | Lowest-latency inference |
| **Ollama** | Local, no API key, privacy |

Adding a new provider is ~10 lines in [`platform/api/model_registry.py`](platform/api/model_registry.py). See [`docs/concepts/model-providers.mdx`](web/content/docs/concepts/model-providers.mdx).
